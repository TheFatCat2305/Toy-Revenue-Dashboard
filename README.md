# Maven Toys Monthly Sales Dashboard

## Project Description
Maven Toys, a small toy store chain in the US, I will develop a new monthly dashboard tailored for the companyâ€™s Regional Sales Managers. This dashboard is designed to provide dynamic insights into sales performance, enabling managers to filter data by region, track monthly revenue trends, and analyze performance year-over-year. Additionally, the dashboard allows for comparison across stores and highlights specific products that have driven the most significant gains and losses.

## Questions from Stakeholders
The following key questions were posed by stakeholders to guide the development of this dashboard:
1. **Can we build a dashboard that allows filtering by region?**
2. **How can we track monthly revenue trends through the dashboard?**
3. **Is it possible to see performance year-over-year within the same dashboard?**
4. **Can we compare performance across different stores?**
5. **How can we identify which specific products drove the biggest gains and which ones incurred the most losses?**

These questions aim to address the need for a comprehensive view of sales performance across different dimensions and timeframes.

## Dataset Summary
**Time Period:** Monthly sales figures from January 2020 to July 2021.

The line chart displays revenue trends, with the blue line representing 2021 and the gray line for 2020. The horizontal axis shows the month, and the vertical axis shows the revenue.

**Can we compare performance across different stores?**

This feature allows you to filter and compare store performance within a region. Bars in blue depict the revenue of stores in a specific region and their month-to-month performance changes.

**How can we identify which specific products drove the biggest gains and which ones incurred the most losses?**
